#What is Musicclip 

Musicclip is a web application that curates all sorts of information about your favorite music bands. The site has several page sections: 

From the video section, you can play songs and music videos for your searched music artists. 

From the album section, you can find a discography of albums created by your searched music artists. 

User motivation: 

Musicclip was made as a tool to discover produced albums and music videos by music artists. Sometimes, you’ll hop on to YouTube to look for music videos and songs by an artist, then go to Spotify to look for the artist’s discography as well. Musicclip combines both into one convenient page with a friendly and easy to use interface.
