User motivation: 

Musicclip was made as a tool to discover produced albums and music videos by music artists. Sometimes, you’ll hop on to YouTube to look for music videos and songs by an artist, then go to Spotify to look for the artist’s discography as well. Perhaps you may even want their bio and some more information that you can find in Wikipedia. Musicclip combines all of them into one convenient page with an interface that is easy to use.
